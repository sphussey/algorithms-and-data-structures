Matrix chain multiplication

Our goal is only to determine an order for multiplying 
# matrices that has the lowest cost. Typically, the time 
# invested in determining this optimal order is more than 
# paid for by the time saved later on when actually 
# performing the matrix multiplications (such as performing 
# only 7500 scalar multiplications instead of 75,000).
